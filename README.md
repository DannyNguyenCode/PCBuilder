## Website features

This website will allow users to select computer components and compare prices. <br>
By selecting a piece, the algorithm will determine if the components are compatible and display the pieces for selection. <br><br>
Basically, if you select a component the algorithm will allow you to select other components that are only compatible with the recent piece you have selected. Will also display a price, which includes individual price of each component and total price.<br><br>
